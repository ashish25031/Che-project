        <center><p>Clean, fresh water is a limited resource. With all the severe droughts happening in the world,
            the limited supply of fresh water is becoming one of our most precious resources. Every person on
            earth needs water to survive. Without it, many of us would get sick and even result in death.</p>

            <l1>While almost 70% of the Earth is made up of water, many parts of the world suffer from clean water
            shortage. Conserving water is important because it keeps water pure and clean while protecting the
            environment.</l1>

                        <p>Water availability is a critical factor for sustaining life and supporting various human
                            activities. It refers to the accessibility of water for both human and ecosystem needs. This
                            includes not only the physical presence of water but also its quality and suitability for
                            use. Water availability is essential for agriculture, human consumption, industry, and
                            energy generation. It encompasses both surface water, such as rivers and lakes, and
                            groundwater stored beneath the Earth's surface.</p>

                        <l1>Challenges related to water availability include water scarcity in certain regions, water
                            pollution, and the sustainable management of water resources. Geoscientists play a
                            significant role in understanding how water moves, helping to locate and quantify surface
                            water and groundwater. Threats to water availability include water scarcity, pollution,
                            conflicts over water resources, and the impact of climate change.</l1>

                        <p>Efforts to address these challenges involve responsible water management, conservation, and
                            equitable distribution of this vital resource. Understanding water availability is crucial
                            for ensuring that current and future generations have access to clean and safe water for
                            various needs.

                    <span class="white-text">
                        <p>Conserving water is essential for several reasons:</p>
                        <li>Limited Availability: Only about 3 percent of the Earth's water is available for human consumption, making it a scarce
                        resource. The rest is saltwater or inaccessible.</li>
                        <li>Waste Reduction: A significant amount of water is wasted due to inefficient use and pollution. Conserving water reduces
                        this waste, ensuring a sustainable supply for future generations.</li>
                        <li>Environmental Impact: Water conservation benefits wildlife and ecosystems. It saves energy used to filter, heat, and
                        pump water, reducing carbon emissions and protecting aquatic habitats.</li>
                        <li>Demonstrates leadership in resource management: Utilities that conserve water demonstrate leadership in resource
                        management and are working toward a goal of sustainability.</li>
                        <li>Ensures that future generations have an adequate water supply: Due to the growing population and urbanization, we are
                        utilizing water vigorously without thinking of our future generations.</li>
